    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>3/4 lb lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6 oz) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 oz) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1-1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1-1/2 teaspoons salt divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon grounf black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 lb mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 seaspoon salt, pepper, and half of the parsley into a small bowl. This will be your meat seasoning mixture.</li>
            <li>Using a Dutch oven, cook the sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until cooked through. No need for oil as the fat from the meat will suffice. Drain any excess fat. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Add in the seasoning mixture and simmer, covered, for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the lasagana noodles in the boiling water for 8-10 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse them with cold water. Using papertowels, dry off the noodles, setting them asside.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and remaining salt. Store this in the fridge until assembly.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 375 deg F as sauce finishes reducing.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over the meat, or enough noodles to fully cover the meat with no overlap. Spread the noodles with half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 cups of the meat sauce over the mozzarella slices, and sprinkle the meat with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozerella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent stickling, wither spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil doesn not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil, baking for an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
